/// Things to Remember
/// - During template type deduction, arguments that are references are treated as non-references,
///   i.e., their reference-ness is ignored.
/// - When deducing types for universal reference parameters, lvalue arguments get special treatment.
/// - When deducing types for by-value parameters, const and/or volatile arguments are treated as non-const and non-volatile.
/// - During template type deduction, arguments that are array or function names decay to pointers,
///   unless theyâ€™re used to initialize references.
